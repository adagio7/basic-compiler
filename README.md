# Compiler

## Description

This is a simple compiler that reads a file and generates a list of tokens. The tokens are then used to generate an abstract syntax tree (AST) which is then used to generate the intermediate code. The intermediate code is then used to generate the final code.

This project uses stack to build and run the project.

## How to run

```bash
$ stack run
```

## How to test

```bash
$ stack test
```
